# 🔥 Crossfire NCR Project

The **Crossfire NCR** project is a web-based Non-Conformance Report (NCR) management system.  
It is built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, following a **global styling system** to ensure design consistency.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

To clone the repository into your local machine and open it in **VS Code**:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone <your-repo-url>.git

# Move into the project folder
cd <your-project-folder>

# Open in VS Code
code .

```
### 2. Git Workflow Commands

```bash
# Switch to your branch
git checkout branch-name

# Pull the latest changes from main
git pull origin main

# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Your commit message here"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main

```

### 3. Go to Github
Then, create a Pull Request (PR) into main for review.

### 4. 🎨 Styling Guidelines

All CSS must be written in style.css.

Follow the global style variables defined at the top of style.css.

Do not create multiple CSS files – keep all styles consistent and centralized.

Always test UI changes in both Light Mode and Dark Mode.

### 6. ✅ Contribution Checklist

Pull the latest changes before starting work.

Work on your branch instead of pushing directly to main.

Follow the global CSS style rules when writing in (style.css).

Test your changes in Light Mode and Dark Mode.

Use clear commit messages (e.g., feat: add dark mode toggle or fix: sidebar not scrolling).

Create a Pull Request for review.

### 7. 👨‍💻 Contributors

Follow the above workflow for smooth collaboration.

Stick to one code style and do not override global CSS variables without discussion.
